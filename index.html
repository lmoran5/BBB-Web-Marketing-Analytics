The test detects amyloid plaques in the brain, a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease, by quantifying Amyloid Beta 42/40 ratio (Aϐ 42/40) and detection of Apolipoprotein E proteotype (equivalent to ApoE genotype) in blood samples using their proprietary mass spectrometry platform.</td>

		<td>The Quest AD-Detect® test is a blood-based diagnostic tool designed to assess the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology in adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia. It measures the ratio of beta-amyloid 42 (Aβ42) to beta-amyloid 40 (Aβ40) in plasma using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).</td>

<td>The test meausres pTau217 in blood, which can signal amyloid and tau accumulation in the brain <b>years before cognitive symptoms</b></td>

<td>The GFAP test is the first test for glial fibrillary acidic protein, a blood-based biomarker for the early detection of neurodegenerative diseases and neurological injuries. The test uses highly sensitive immunoassay technology to measure the presence of GFAP from a simple blood draw. </td>
